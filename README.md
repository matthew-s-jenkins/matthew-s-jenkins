### Data-Driven Solutions for Supply Chain & Operations

I build automated systems and data models that solve critical business challenges.

With a proven history of delivering significant cost reductions, I connect process improvements to measurable financial outcomes. 

I'm currently building on extensive operational expertise with a B.S. in Accounting to master the financial impact of data-driven business optimization.

### [Digital Harvest - Accounting-Based Business Simulator](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim)

An interactive business simulation engine built on a foundation of real-world accounting principles. This project creates a "digital twin" of a retail business, allowing a user to make strategic decisions while accurately tracking the downstream impact on a double-entry accounting ledger. It showcases the powerful intersection of software engineering, database design, and financial analysis.
