# Matthew S. Jenkins

### Senior Data Analyst | SQL & Dashboard Development | Strategy & Operations

I build software that solves real operational and financial challenges. With 5+ years building reporting infrastructure that drives strategic decisions across 24 retail locations, I've seen firsthand how the right data tools transform business outcomes. Now completing a B.S. in Accounting (already hold B.S. in IT), I'm combining technical depth with financial expertise to build tools that help businesses operate with precision.

## The Journey

These projects aren't just portfolio pieces - they're an evolving system. Each one solved a real problem and became the foundation for the next:

**Digital Harvest** started as a way to generate realistic business data for Power BI practice - the same kind of data I analyzed professionally, but on demand. Building the simulation taught me that accurate financial tracking requires proper accounting architecture.

**Perfect Books** emerged when I needed to manage my own finances as an independent contractor. Budget trackers weren't enough - I needed real double-entry accounting. The system I built for myself became production-ready software.

**Next:** These foundations are becoming business operations software - inventory management, FIFO costing, and financial reporting for small businesses who need enterprise-grade accuracy without enterprise complexity.

## Featured Projects

### [Perfect Books - Personal Finance Application](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/perfect-books)

**The Problem:** As an independent contractor with variable income and multiple accounts, I needed financial software that worked like a real accounting system - not just a budget tracker that loses precision.

**The Solution:** A full double-entry accounting system that maintains an immutable audit trail while remaining intuitive enough for daily use.

**Key Features:**
- Double-entry bookkeeping across all account types (checking, savings, credit cards, loans)
- Budget planning with spending limits and visual progress tracking
- Savings goals with target dates and account linking
- Business vs. personal transaction separation for tax tracking
- 9 interactive analysis charts including net worth trends and financial runway
- Real-time balance calculations with complete transaction history

**Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python + Flask REST API
- **Database:** SQLite with normalized schema and referential integrity
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS with 6 customizable themes
- **Architecture:** Stateless API, immutable ledger, audit-ready design

### [Digital Harvest - Business Simulation & Analytics Platform](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim)

**The Problem:** I wanted to practice Power BI analysis on realistic business data, but couldn't find datasets with the complexity of real retail operations - seasonal trends, weekly patterns, inventory dynamics, and proper financial tracking.

**The Solution:** A fully playable business simulation with real accounting accuracy. Run a keyboard shop, tech store, or vertical farm while the system generates analytically meaningful data with proper double-entry bookkeeping.

**Key Features:**
- Three unique businesses with different volatility profiles and product catalogs
- Realistic demand modeling with seasonal trends, weekly patterns, and random market events
- 90-day business maturity system - new businesses build customer base gradually
- Complete supply chain: vendors, lead times, minimum orders, accounts payable
- FIFO inventory costing with perpetual tracking
- **Full 3-statement financial reporting** - Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement
- **Analytics dashboard** with Chart.js graphs for revenue trends and sales velocity
- Days supply calculations throughout for inventory planning
- Direct Power BI integration for advanced analytics

**Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python + Flask REST API with game engine
- **Database:** SQLite with normalized schema, FIFO cost layers, double-entry ledger
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
- **Architecture:** Shares accounting foundation with Perfect Books

### Artifact Live - Business Operations Platform (Coming Soon)

**The Vision:** Taking the battle-tested accounting and inventory systems from these projects and building operational software for real businesses - starting with FIFO inventory management and expanding toward a lightweight ERP solution.

**Current State:** Core inventory tracking with FIFO cost layers functional. Building toward purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and customizable business wrappers.
