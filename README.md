# Matthew S. Jenkins

### Supply Chain & Operations Analyst | Data-Driven Problem Solver

I build software that solves real operational and financial challenges. With 5+ years analyzing sales and inventory data in retail, I'm now completing a B.S. in Accounting to deepen my expertise in cost analysis and financial operations. My projects demonstrate how technical skills and business knowledge combine to drive better decisions.

## Featured Projects

### [Perfect Books - Personal Finance Application](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/perfect-books)

A personal finance application built on double-entry accounting principles to manage multiple accounts, track debt, and maintain financial integrity. As an independent contractor with fluctuating income and multiple credit cards, I needed a tool that worked like a real accounting system - not just a budget tracker.

**What It Does:**
- Tracks all accounts (checking, savings, credit cards, loans) with proper double-entry bookkeeping
- Provides real-time net worth calculation and debt visualization
- Automates recurring transactions with variable amount support
- Maintains an immutable audit trail - transactions can be reversed but never deleted
- Includes interactive analytics with drill-down capabilities

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend:** Python + Flask REST API with stateless architecture
- **Database:** MySQL with normalized schema designed for data integrity
- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI
- **Key Challenge:** Implementing running balance calculations efficiently while maintaining complete transaction history

**Business Value:** Demonstrates understanding of accounting principles, data integrity, and building production-ready financial systems.

### [Digital Harvest - Business Simulation & Analytics Platform](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim)

A full-stack simulation engine that models retail operations with accounting accuracy. Built to generate realistic sales data for Power BI analysis - the same kind of data I worked with professionally, but on demand.

**What It Does:**
- Simulates complete retail operations: sales, inventory, procurement, and financial tracking
- Models realistic demand with seasonal trends, weekly patterns, and market events
- Implements perpetual inventory with FIFO costing
- Manages supply chain decisions: vendor selection, lead times, and order optimization
- Connects directly to Power BI for advanced analytics

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend:** Python simulation engine with double-entry accounting
- **Database:** MySQL star schema optimized for BI connectivity
- **Analytics:** Power BI dashboards for sales trends, inventory analysis, and vendor ROI
- **Key Challenge:** Creating demand algorithms that produce data realistic enough for meaningful analysis

**Business Value:** Demonstrates supply chain management principles, inventory optimization, demand forecasting, and financial modeling.
